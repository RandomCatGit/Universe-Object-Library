# Universe-Object-Library

The concept of <b>Object Oriented Programming</b> is an interesting one. We can trace real world objects as code with things as properties and actions as procedures. This project aims to provide a repository where everything in the universe gets represented as a Real World Object of Java class.

This repository will be the first open source, widely-cited, anyone-can-contribute type which encourages programming in communities.

Feel free to check out the rules and add your contributon to the Javaverse!
