/**
 * Anammoxosome is a large intracytoplasmic compartment bounded by a single bilayer ladderane lipid-containing membrane
 * present in bacteria that perform anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). This specific organelle is the site of
 * anammox process, in which nitrite is used as the electron acceptor in the conversion of ammonium to dinitrogen (N2)
 * gas and water. Anammox bacteria belong to the phylum Planctomycetes and are recognized as major players in the global
 * nitrogen cycle.
