 * WhiteFatCell or monovacuolar cells contain a large lipid droplet surrounded by a layer of cytoplasm. The nucleus is
 * flattened and located on the periphery. A typical fat cell is 0.1 mm in diameter with some being twice that size and
 * others half that size. The fat stored is in a semi-liquid state, and is composed primarily of triglycerides and
 * cholesteryl ester.
