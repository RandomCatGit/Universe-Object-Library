 * BrownFatCell or plurivacuolar cells are polyhedral in shape. Unlike white fat cells, these cells have considerable
 * cytoplasm, with lipid droplets scattered throughout. The nucleus is round, and, although eccentrically located, it is
 * not in the periphery of the cell. The brown color comes from the large quantity of mitochondria. Brown fat, also
 * known as "baby fat," is used to generate heat.
